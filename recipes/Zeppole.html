    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Zeppole are Italian donuts made with ricotta cheese that are traditionally served warm in paper bags with lots of
        confectioners' sugar at Italian festivals or carnivals.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 Â½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir in eggs, ricotta cheese, and
            vanilla. Mix gently over low heat until combined. Batter will be sticky.</li>
        <li>Drop by tablespoons into the hot oil a few at a time. Zeppole will turn over by themselves. Fry until golden
